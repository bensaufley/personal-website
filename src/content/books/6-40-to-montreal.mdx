import Spoiler from '~components/reading/Spoiler.astro';

I don't know. I was very intrigued by the premise of this book, but the execution was underwhelming. Firstly, even with the aid of the fact that it's winter where I am now, the book didn't have that kind of cold _feel_ to it, the "we're trapped inside with the snow piling up outside" feeling. Something about how it was told. And then the resolution of the mystery was … disappointing. I had to go back and read it a few times to see if I'd missed something, but I hadn't. It's contrived, kind of out of left field, and with a lot of open questions. <Spoiler>I still don't get how or why the spider factors into it, and who the guy who died was to our protagonist – nobody? Her husband just killed a stranger to spice up their life? And there's some implication that things might point at her as the culprit, but why would they? And all of this … with a few months left to live? Your husband murdered a guy so you wouldn't have an affair before you die? Really?</Spoiler> Honestly the more I think about it all the madder I get about the resolution.
