Adequately entertaining. I don't tend to red series immediately in sequence but
I almost rushed to pick up the next. It's a bit cartoonish, and I think probably
the premise justifies that even if I do think some of the concepts introduced in
this series, while fanciful, are fascinating and could probably be explored with
a bit more seriousness. I'll definitely read the next, soon.
