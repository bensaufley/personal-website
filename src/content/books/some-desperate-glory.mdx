import Spoiler from '~components/reading/Spoiler.astro';

After just two novels (this and _The Incandescent_) Tesh has immediately made my list of preorder/instant buy on release authors. This book starts off with a certain set of pretty familiar tropes but very soon it's clear that there's more to this world, and not just in that _other_ trope-y way (although, yes, that too). At each stage of this novel's plot I had no idea where it was going to go next, but each time I was satisfied with what did. Tesh set up a premise that, for me, didn't have a clear morally-just outcome, and then navigated it through some captivating scenarios to a pretty satisfying conclusion.

One thing that struck me as I finished this book is that I am so often bored out of my skull by stories that are _close_ to this: galaxy-wide stakes, hand-wavy sci-fi devices with minimal grounding rules, all approaching a big race-against-the-clock climax; these things tend to pull back from the characters, especially in the third act, and in doing so they lose my interest. I don't think that happened here. Maybe because I was very bought-in; maybe because Tesh does well to keep the focus on the characters. Certainly because there are very few drawn-out combat scenes.

I think it was really interesting to watch Kyr's character develop slowly over the course of the novel, and especially in the end of the first act, when <Spoiler>it kind of becomes clear that she is, at that point, not really a "good guy." Her attitudes, her indoctrination, encountering the truths out there, is a fascinating thing to watch, and while I think it happened a little quickly, I think Tesh did very well to never make it so plain as "Kyr was wrong and now she's learning what's right."</Spoiler>

My major gripe is not very major at all: <Spoiler>as the end approached, and it looked like Kyr might die in accomplishing her goal, I was disappointed—but then, when she was snatched from that fate, it felt a little cheap too.</Spoiler> But not massively. In the end, I absolutely loved this novel.
