import Spoiler from '~components/reading/Spoiler.astro';

I think this wrapped up the series pretty well. I do feel like, at times, it was almost more of a kind of description of a possible ideal (with a big asterisk) future than a _novel_, and it almost left the characters behind as it did that. And I'm not actually sure I think the eventual state of affairs <Spoiler>on Earth</Spoiler> is any kind of improvement, all things considered. But it was internally consistent and thought-provoking. As I've said with the whole series, it takes some pretty interesting ideas and applies a kind of layer of cartoonishness to it all, but again, I think it stuck the landing for what it was well enough.

It was interesting that at a certain point, I started wondering if the book was going to wrap up as an appeal to faith. There was a part of the book that very much felt like it was trying to draw parallels (beyond, obviously, the Tonists more explicitly) between The Thunderhead and some kind of deity—not just _within_ the novels' universe, which happened a lot, but more as a meta-narrative. In the end I don't think it went that way.

<Spoiler>
  I do kind of wish we learned more about the world Citra and Rowan ended up building—we learned a bit about the Tonists
  through the theological interludes (and, disappointingly, learned how much information was clearly lost), but we only
  got a brief look at Citra waking up at the very end.
