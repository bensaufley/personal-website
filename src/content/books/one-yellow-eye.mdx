import Spoiler from '~components/reading/Spoiler.astro';

I really, really enjoyed this book. It's very accessible, really keeps you coming back, but it's also got a lot of layers to it. There is a point in the second act—<Spoiler>when she starts trying to recruit for human trials herself</Spoiler>—where I briefly felt like "wow, has this gone off the rails" but it's resolved in a satisfying way that makes sense in-universe and advances the plot. I was not really prepared for how it would end, which was unexpected but actually a really great way to end it. The fact that this story was inspired by the author watching her father die of cancer really adds something to the overall impact of the story, to me.
