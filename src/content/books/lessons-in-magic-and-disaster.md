I had less _fun_ reading this book than others I've read by Anders. Which is not to say it's a bad book, because it's not. It's just a different kind of book. There's a lot of pain in this one, a lot of reckoning with a world full of hate and bigotry. Not every book needs to be an escape, but I'm not sure I prepared myself for how tough some of this book would be. Still definitely recommend it, as with basically everything else in the CJA catalog.
