For a book that I've seen everywhere, which has now been turned into a miniseries, this was a pretty standard, unsurprising kind of thriller. Not a lot happened; not a lot of red herrings or interesting side plots. And after it was revealed what had happened to the protagonist's husband, I kept thinking what else there could be—what the next twist would be—because that couldn't be it. But that was it! If you'd asked me to guess at a cliché after the first chapter, this would've been on the list.
