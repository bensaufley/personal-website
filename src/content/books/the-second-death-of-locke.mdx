import Spoiler from '~components/reading/Spoiler.astro';

I really liked this book. The magic is interesting, the characters are
sympathetic and compelling, and the romance is sweet and sincere. I think the
third act lost me a little bit as action films sometimes do—I start to tune out
when the conflicts get larger and less personal—but it never zoomed _too_ far
out, and I think it stuck the landing well-enough, <Spoiler>albeit with a bit of
a _deus ex machina_, almost literally, averting any significant
stakes.</Spoiler>

The book also does admirably at injecting a pretty familiar Arthurian fantasy
setting with some subversion of the Anglo puritanism you might expect, and I
think it did it very naturally, and in a number of ways that allowed characters
to simply _be_ rather than needing to provide some narrative purpose in their
identity. Though it's probably worth noting that the central protagonists are by
all appearances cis and though the characters are bi, the central romance is
straight. Which is of course OK! But it does then leave the trans and nonbinary
characters, and queer stories, in the background.
