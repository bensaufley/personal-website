import Spoiler from '~components/reading/Spoiler.astro';

This one was a lot of fun. I think I went in expecting, I don't know what to call it, a "domestic thriller?" And maybe it's a spoiler, though the first "twist" happens quite early—<Spoiler>it's more of a heist or crime thriller.</Spoiler> So I think for a bit I was kind of disoriented, my mind still trying to turn it into a different kind of book. But once I adjusted my frame of view, it was a fun ride. Lots of twists, many of which I didn't anticipate. I'll definitely pick up Elston's next.
