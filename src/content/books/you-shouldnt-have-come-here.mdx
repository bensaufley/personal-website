import Spoiler from '~components/reading/Spoiler.astro';

This was … not good. A good 60% of the book had no plot movement, no tension except for a mild will they/won't they. The writing was extremely corny. I enjoyed Jeneva Rose's "Perfect" books for what they were, but this – written, I think, before those? – was not even that. I'm not entirely sure why I don't rate this lower, but I suppose a few points for the mildly interesting "twist" that came about five minutes after anything resembling plot started taking place and ten before the end of the book. But even then, <Spoiler>from the beginning, it did seem pretty likely that they were actually both the bad guy – if there was even going to be a bad guy, which was not clear for most of the book. Both, or neither! But yep, both.</Spoiler>
